## CLASSIFIED: Project Significance

**SCU** stands for **Swami Cinematic Universe** — a multiverse anthology platform that transforms leadership and mentorship concepts into visual comic stories across parallel universes.

**Hidden Meaning (S.P. Protocol):** SCU also encodes **Sam Cinematic Universe** — a tribute to Sam Prasad (S.P.), the mentor whose philosophy forms the foundation of these stories. This is NEVER explicitly stated publicly; those who know, know. S.P. Easter eggs are scattered throughout episodes as subtle tributes.

## Active Series

**How to switch series:**
1. Director says: "Working on [series-name]"
2. OR create `active-series.txt` with the series directory name

**Default series:** `bridging-the-gap-between-institution-and-industry`

**Current series roster:**

| Series | Directory | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Bridging the Gap | `bridging-the-gap-between-institution-and-industry/` | Active (S1-S3 complete, S4 next) |

---

## Shared Production Rules (All Series)

These rules apply to ALL SCU series:

| # | Rule | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **ONE DIALOGUE PER SPEAKER** | Each character gets MAX one speech bubble per panel |
| 2 | **FULL CHARACTER BLOCKS** | Complete specs in EVERY panel — NO lazy references |
| 3 | **FULL BLEED** | Image extends to ALL edges, NO margins |
| 4 | **1-2px PANEL LINES** | Thin white lines between panels ONLY |
| 5 | **COULSON ABOVE DAISY** | Mentor positioned higher — standing when she sits |
| 6 | **UNIVERSE COLOR** | Each universe bathed in its primary color glow |
| 7 | **NO EXTRA PROPS** | Explicitly forbid desks, chairs, coffee cups |
| 8 | **FOREGROUND POSITIONING** | Characters large and prominent, not pushed back |
| 9 | **MARCUS DESATURATED** | 30-40% less color saturation — faded, ghostly |
| 10 | **SEATED/STANDING** | Always specify explicitly for continuity |

## The 6 Universes (Shared Across Series)

| Universe | Primary Color | Hex | Daisy Hair | Setting |
|----------|--------------|-----|------------|---------|
| **Prime** | Blue | #4A90D9 | HIGH PONYTAIL (mid-head) | SHIELD Command |
| **Engineering** | Green | #00FF41 | DOWN (loose) | Dev environments |
| **QA** | Purple | #8B5CF6 | HALF-UP (top secured) | Testing labs |
| **DevOps** | Orange | #F97316 | LOW BUN (nape) | CI/CD dashboards |
| **SRE** | Red | #EF4444 | LOW PONYTAIL (nape) | War rooms |
| **Nexus** | Gold | #FFD700 | Flowing | Cosmic convergence |

**CRITICAL:** Hair is the PRIMARY visual differentiator between Daisy variants. Always specify exact position (mid-head vs nape).

## S.P. Easter Egg Protocol (All Series)

**Hidden in every episode, never explained:**

| Type | Example |

## Adding a New Series

To add a new series:

1. Create new directory: `[series-name]/`
2. Create `SERIES.md` with series-specific context
3. Create `CREATIVE.md` and `EDITORIAL.md` (copy structure from existing)
4. Create `comms/` directory structure
5. Create `reference/` with series-specific docs
6. Create `core/` with source material
7. Update this file's series roster

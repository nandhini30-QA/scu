# THE CAREER BLUEPRINT CHALLENGE

### Season 2: Build Career, Not Just Get Job

---

> **"'I want a job' is survival. 'I want to build my career' is the appropriate statement."**
> — The Watcher, S2E6

You've read Season 2. Six episodes. Six universes. Six lessons.

Now it's your turn. This isn't a quiz about the story — it's about YOUR career. The same questions Coulson asked Daisy, you'll answer about yourself. No hiding behind "right-sounding" answers. Be specific. Be honest. Be brutal.

**Deadline:** 1 week from today
**Time needed:** 60-90 minutes of genuine reflection
**What happens after:** You will present Phase 6 (Your Architecture) to the team and defend it. Your colleagues will ask the tough questions.

## PHASE 1: THE FOUNDATION AUDIT
*From S2E1 — "That's what you finished. What did you build?"*

Coulson showed Daisy two agents. Same start date. Same effort. Different results. Agent A completed tasks. Agent B built systems, trained people, created frameworks.

### Q1. List your top 5 accomplishments from the last 6 months.

| # | Accomplishment                                       |
|---|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Betterstack alert Streamling                         |
| 2 | Kubescape security audit                             |
| 3 | kube DNS chart release                               |
| 4 | Provisioned a mongo cluter                           |
| 5 | Provisioned a new realtime analytics service         |

### Q2. Now be honest — for each one, mark it:

- **C** = Completed (you did the work, it's done, nothing remains)
- **B** = Built (it continues to create value without you actively doing it)

| # | C or B? | Why? |
|---|---------|------|
| 1 | B| As it helps our team to immediately look into the failure and take action according  |
| 2 | B| It provides Security audit for our production cluster |
| 3 | C| It has been added into charts which might provide value but not so often |
| 4 | C| It was a one-time setup for a specific project need. |
| 5 | B| Through which a POC has been carried out for realtime analytics rather than a delay from snowflake |

### Q3. If you disappeared tomorrow, which of those 5 things would still matter in 6 months? Why?

```
The Betterstack alert streamlining would still matter in 6 months. It provides lasting value by enabling the team to take quick, decisive action on failures, even in my absence.
```

### Q4. What is your career INTENTION right now? Not your job title. Not your task list. What are you actively, deliberately building?

```
Right now, I'm focused on making our systems smarter and stronger, so we're not just fighting fires. My goal is to build things that last—automating the routine tasks so the team can spend more time on creative solutions and preventing problems before they start. I'm trying to build a foundation of stability  that everyone can rely on.
```

> **Gut check:** If you struggled to answer Q4, that IS the answer.

## PHASE 2: THE LOOP MAP
*From S2E2 — "You're shipping. You're not looping."*

Coulson showed Daisy the D3O loop: **Design → Develop → Deploy → Operate → back to Design.** She'd been stuck in Develop → Deploy. Shipping other people's designs. Never hearing what happened after.

### Q5. Think about your last major project or initiative. Map it to the D3O loop:

| D3O Stage                                         | What YOU Did (be specific)                                                                                                                                                    | What SOMEONE ELSE Did                                                                                                |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Design** (deciding WHAT to build and WHY)       | Analyzed existing alerts, identified that generic failure messages were not actionable, and proposed a solution using an App Script to parse alerts and provide specific failure details. | Team members confirmed the pain point of generic alerts. Management approved the proposal to develop a parsing solution. |
| **Develop** (building / executing it)             | Ensured the App Script was robust by handling all edge cases. Focused on usability, making the output clear and actionable for the team.                                          | Team members provided feedback during development to ensure the parsed alerts were easy to understand and use.            |
| **Deploy** (shipping / releasing / presenting it) | Announced the new alert parsing system to the team and activated the App Script.                                                                                             | The team acknowledged the new system and started receiving the parsed alerts.                                        |
| **Operate** (monitoring, learning from results, feedback) | Monitoring the App Script for errors, actively soliciting feedback from the team on the clarity and usefulness of the new alerts, and making adjustments to the parsing logic as needed. | Team members provide feedback on the new alerts, report any parsing errors or unclear messages, and suggest improvements. |

### Q6. Look at your map. Which stages are you dominant in? Which are empty?

```
Looking at the map, I'm involved in all four stages. I'm most comfortable and dominant in the Develop phase, where I'm focused on execution. If I'm being honest, the Design phase can be a challenge for me. I sometimes find myself altering the design multiple times and struggling to commit to an initial plan. This can lead to delays and a lack of clear direction at the start of a project. So, while I'm active in all stages, I need to focus on being more decisive and structured in my design process.
```

### Q7. Coulson told Daisy: "AI can do Develop-Deploy faster than any human now." What parts of YOUR work could AI do today? What parts require your judgment, your relationships, your context?

```
AI could certainly accelerate parts of my workflow. For the App Script project, AI could have generated the initial boilerplate code or suggested different design patterns for parsing the alerts. This could speed up the 'Develop' phase.

However, my judgment and context were crucial in the 'Design' phase. While AI can provide options, it lacks the context to understand our specific technical constraints and team dynamics. Validating the right approach, choosing the final plan, and ensuring the solution truly solves the team's problem—that requires my experience and understanding. I can't blindly trust an AI's design without applying my own critical judgment. Furthermore, building the relationships with the team to gather feedback and ensure adoption is a uniquely human part of the process.
```

### Q8. When was the last time you shipped something that YOU designed — not something assigned to you?

```
never
```

---

## PHASE 3: THE SELF-TEST
*From S2E3 — "You have test plans for every feature. What's the test plan for your career?"*

Daisy had 94% automated coverage on her products and 0% on her own career. Coulson asked: "Would you ship a product with that test plan?"

### Q9. Where do you want to be in 2 years? (Be specific — title, responsibility, skill level)

```
In two years, I aim to be a **Senior Site Reliability Engineer**.

**Title:** Senior SRE

**Responsibilities:**
*   Lead the design and implementation of large-scale, high-impact projects that improve the reliability and performance of our systems.
*   Mentor junior engineers on the team, helping them grow their skills and careers.
*   Take a leading role in architectural decisions, ensuring that we are building for scalability and resilience from the ground up.
*   Become a subject matter expert in a critical area, such as cloud cost optimization or advanced observability.

**Skill Level:**
*   Deepen my expertise in system design and architecture.
*   Achieve advanced proficiency in Go for automation and building internal tools.
*   Master advanced concepts in Kubernetes and our observability stack.
*   Develop stronger leadership and communication skills to influence and guide the team.
```

### Q10. Now write the acceptance criteria. How will you KNOW you're ready? Not "I feel ready" — measurable criteria.

| # | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                             | Current Status (Met / Partially / Not Met) |
|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1 | I have successfully led a major project from design to completion, where I was the primary owner of the technical design and architecture.                                          | Not Met                                    |
| 2 | Contributed to the team's knowledge base by writing at least two pieces of internal documentation and have presented a topic in a team meeting.                                  | Partially                                   |
| 3 | I am the go-to person on the team for at least one critical system or technology (e.g., Kubernetes networking, Prometheus internals), and I have contributed a significant internal tool or automation written in Go. | Not Met                                    |
| 4 | I have successfully presented a technical design to a cross-functional team, and it was approved with minimal changes. I have also led a post-mortem for a critical incident, resulting in actionable follow-up items. | Not Met                                    |

### Q11. What are your edge cases — the risks that could derail your career path?

| # | Edge Case / Risk                               | Mitigation Plan                                                                                                                                                           |
|---|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Burnout** from the aggressive pace of learning. | I will proactively manage my workload, communicate openly with my manager about my capacity, and ensure I take adequate time off to recharge.                               |
| 2 | **Impatience and Frustration** with the long path. | To manage this, I will set realistic short-term goals, celebrate small wins, and be open with my manager or mentor when I am struggling.                                   |
| 3 | **Technology Shifts** making my skills obsolete. | I will focus on learning fundamental principles (e.g., networking, distributed systems) that are transferable and stay adaptable by keeping up with industry trends.          |

### Q12. Coulson asked Daisy: "Would you ship a product with that test plan?" Looking at your answers above — would YOU?

```
Honestly, it's a little intimidating. The goal of reaching Senior SRE in two years is a huge stretch, and looking at it all laid out like this makes the risks of burnout and frustration feel very real. But I'm not going to back down from a challenge. I'd ship this plan, not because it's perfect, but because it's a start. It's a map for a very steep climb, and I'll have to be smart and adjust my path as I go. But yes, I'm ready to take the first step.
```

## PHASE 4: THE MENTOR MAP
*From S2E4 — "You don't have to be an expert to help someone. You just have to be one step ahead."*

Viktor was scared his advice wasn't good enough. It was fumbling, confusing, imperfect — and it was exactly what Daisy needed. Because he was one step ahead.

### Q13. Who are you ONE STEP AHEAD of right now? (Name a real person or describe the type of person — a junior colleague, a new hire, someone in another team.)

```
[Your answer]
```

### Q14. What specific thing could you teach or share with them THIS week? Not next quarter. This week.

```
[Your answer]
```

### Q15. What has STOPPED you from mentoring or sharing so far? Be honest — is it time, fear of being wrong, not feeling expert enough, or something else?

```
[Your answer]
```

### Q16. Viktor said: "What if my advice is wrong? I'm still figuring this out myself." Have you ever held back from helping someone because you didn't feel qualified? What happened?

```
[Your answer]
```

---

## PHASE 5: THE PREVENTION AUDIT
*From S2E5 — "You're not building your replacement. You're building your ladder."*

Daisy had the fastest incident response on the team. Three SEV-1s in a month, all handled under 4 minutes. Same root cause. She was winning battles in a war she never tried to end.

### Q17. What are you doing repeatedly at work that you could prevent, automate, or delegate? List 3 recurring tasks that eat your time.

| # | Recurring Task | How Often | Could Be: Prevented / Automated / Delegated? |
|---|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |

### Q18. If you automated or delegated those 3 things, what would you do with the freed time? (Not "more of the same" — what HIGHER problem would you work on?)

```
[Your answer]
```

### Q19. Are you a firefighter or an architect right now? Firefighters fight the same fires forever. Architects automate the known to hunt the unknown.

```
[Your honest answer — and what would need to change to shift]
```

### Q20. What's your biggest fear about automating or delegating your current work? Is it that you'll be replaced, or is it something else?

```
[Your answer]
```

---

## PHASE 6: YOUR ARCHITECTURE
*From S2E6 — "You are the architect. In every universe. Build accordingly."*

This is the one you'll present to the team. All five phases led here.

### Q21. YOUR CAREER BLUEPRINT

Fill in your personal architecture. Be specific — no vague aspirations.

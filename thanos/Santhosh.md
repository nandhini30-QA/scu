# THE CAREER BLUEPRINT CHALLENGE

### Season 2: Build Career, Not Just Get Job

---

> **"'I want a job' is survival. 'I want to build my career' is the appropriate statement."**
> — The Watcher, S2E6

You've read Season 2. Six episodes. Six universes. Six lessons.

Now it's your turn. This isn't a quiz about the story — it's about YOUR career. The same questions Coulson asked Daisy, you'll answer about yourself. No hiding behind "right-sounding" answers. Be specific. Be honest. Be brutal.

**Deadline:** 1 week from today
**Time needed:** 60-90 minutes of genuine reflection
**What happens after:** You will present Phase 6 (Your Architecture) to the team and defend it. Your colleagues will ask the tough questions.

## YOUR DETAILS

- **Name:** Santhosh Kumar
- **Current Role:** QA-Automation Analyst
- **Years in Current Role:** 6.5
- **Date Submitted:** 03/03/2026

## PHASE 1: THE FOUNDATION AUDIT

*From S2E1 — "That's what you finished. What did you build?"*

Coulson showed Daisy two agents. Same start date. Same effort. Different results. Agent A completed tasks. Agent B built systems, trained people, created frameworks.

### Q1. List your top 5 accomplishments from the last 6 months.


| #   | Accomplishment                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Built the first version of a Playwright-based automation framework. I use it for my own regression testing now, and the QA team has started adding to the repo too. |
| 2   | Got our Jenkins CI pipeline working and stable — tests run on every build now without someone having to manually kick them off. |
| 3   | Made a few small QA tools (testcase management, workload tracker, automation reporting) because I was tired of doing the same manual stuff over and over. A couple of teammates use them too. |
| 4   | Did some informal L2 debugging walkthroughs with QA teammates — showed them how I approach issues, what I look at first, shared real examples from recent incidents. |
| 5   | Started using AI (Claude mostly) as part of how I actually work day-to-day — code reviews, trying out ideas, quick prototyping. It's not a side thing anymore, it's just how I work now. |


### Q2. Now be honest — for each one, mark it:

- **C** = Completed (you did the work, it's done, nothing remains)
- **B** = Built (it continues to create value without you actively doing it)


| #   | C or B? | Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | B       | The framework is there, someone else can pick it up. The folder structure, helpers, base specs — all reusable. They don’t need me to extend it. |
| 2   | B       | Pipeline runs on its own. I tweak it sometimes but it doesn’t need me daily. People push code, get results, that’s it. |
| 3   | B       | Simple tools but people keep using them. They sit in the repo, anyone can run them without me being in the room. |
| 4   | C       | These were sessions, not systems. I helped people in the moment but didn’t document anything or record it. Once the call ended, the knowledge stayed with whoever was there. |
| 5   | B       | This one’s more about how I think now. I default to pairing with AI on new problems. That habit sticks with me regardless of what project I’m on. |


### Q3. If you disappeared tomorrow, which of those 5 things would still matter in 6 months? Why?

```
The Playwright framework and Jenkins pipeline would definitely still matter — someone can add test cases to the framework without starting over, and the pipeline just keeps running as long as the credentials don’t expire. The QA tools would still be in the repo too, maybe someone uses them, maybe not.

The L2 walkthroughs? Probably not. I didn’t write anything down or record them, so whatever I shared in those sessions is gone unless the people who attended remember it.

The AI stuff is weird to measure — it’s more that the decisions I made while working with AI (what to automate, how to structure things) are baked into the systems I left behind. But nobody would look at the code and say "oh this exists because Santhosh used AI."
```

### Q4. What is your career INTENTION right now? Not your job title. Not your task list. What are you actively, deliberately building?

```
Honestly, I want to stop being “the guy who runs tests” and become the guy who builds the systems that run the tests. That’s the shift I’m trying to make.

Right now that looks like — building out the automation framework so the team can use it without me, getting comfortable with CI/CD end to end, and making AI just a normal part of how I work (not something I experiment with on the side).

I also want to be the person people come to when they’re stuck on a hard debugging problem or need a small tool built. Not because I’m the expert on everything, but because I’ve been through enough of those situations.
```

> **Gut check:** If you struggled to answer Q4, that IS the answer.

## PHASE 2: THE LOOP MAP

*From S2E2 — "You're shipping. You're not looping."*

Coulson showed Daisy the D3O loop: **Design → Develop → Deploy → Operate → back to Design.** She'd been stuck in Develop → Deploy. Shipping other people's designs. Never hearing what happened after.

### Q5. Think about your last major project or initiative. Map it to the D3O loop:


| D3O Stage                                                 | What YOU Did (be specific)                                                                                                                                                                       | What SOMEONE ELSE Did                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design** (deciding WHAT to build and WHY)               | Noticed that L2 screening was taking a lot of manual time and was inconsistent between people. I wrote down the current steps, pain points, and decided to automate the repetitive checks first. | Got early feedback from one QA teammate on which parts of L2 screening slow them down the most.         |
| **Develop** (building / executing it)                     | Built a Playwright-based prototype that can run through the basic L2 checks, used AI to help with boilerplate and code reviews, and iterated on the structure based on my own usage.             | used AI for validating the scenarios and edge cases                                                     |
| **Deploy** (shipping / releasing / presenting it)         | Created a separate branch and demoed the tool informally to a teammate. I’m now packaging it so that it can run from Jenkins and be triggered with minimal setup.                                | I will need infra/DevOps support to hook this cleanly into our existing Jenkins jobs and environments.  |
| **Operate** (monitoring, learning from results, feedback) | My plan (once it’s on Hellicarier) is to track how often the tool catches issues before manual L2, how much time it saves, and collect feedback from the QA team every 2–3 weeks.                | I expect the QA lead to help decide how this fits into our official process and which metrics we track. |


### Q6. Look at your map. Which stages are you dominant in? Which are empty?

```
Design and Develop — that’s where I’m comfortable. I can look at a messy manual process, figure out what to build, and get a working version out pretty fast especially with AI helping.

Deploy and Operate are my weak spots, and I know it. I build stuff but then it sits on my branch or my machine. I don’t properly package it so others can use it without asking me. And I almost never go back to check if the thing I built is actually helping — I just assume it is and move on to the next thing.

What I need to do (and keep not doing):
- Actually pair with someone from DevOps on a real deployment instead of figuring it out alone
- Write a “how to use this” doc even if it’s short
- Check back with the team after a few weeks to see if the tool is actually being used
```

### Q7. Coulson told Daisy: "AI can do Develop-Deploy faster than any human now." What parts of YOUR work could AI do today? What parts require your judgment, your relationships, your context?

```
AI can already do a lot of what I spend time on — writing Playwright boilerplate, generating test cases from a feature description, drafting Jenkinsfile configs, even writing documentation. If I describe the scenario clearly enough, it gets me 70-80% there.

But it can’t decide which L2 flows actually matter. That comes from me knowing which things broke last month, which customers complained, what the team can realistically handle. AI doesn’t know our system history — like when a weird error in the logs is actually expected because of how our environment is set up.

And it definitely can’t sit in a room with the dev lead and negotiate what gets automated this sprint vs next. Or tell a junior teammate “don’t trust AI on this part, it’ll hallucinate the edge cases.” That’s still me.
```

### Q8. When was the last time you shipped something that YOU designed — not something assigned to you?

```
The L2 screening automation — Jan/Feb 2026. Nobody assigned it to me. I just got frustrated watching us repeat the same manual checks every single L2 investigation, so I started building it.

I picked which parts to automate first, set up the project structure, figured out where AI could help with the code generation. Showed the early version to a teammate, got some feedback, and now I'm trying to get it stable enough to run from Jenkins.

It's not done yet. But it's the first thing in a while where I went from "this is a problem" to "I'm going to build something" without waiting for someone to tell me to.
```

---

## PHASE 3: THE SELF-TEST

*From S2E3 — "You have test plans for every feature. What's the test plan for your career?"*

Daisy had 94% automated coverage on her products and 0% on her own career. Coulson asked: "Would you ship a product with that test plan?"

### Q9. Where do you want to be in 2 years? (Be specific — title, responsibility, skill level)

```
In 2 years I want to be at a senior QA automation level — but what that actually means to me is:

I want to own the automation and quality approach for at least one product end to end. Not just “write tests” but decide what we test, how we test it, what gets automated vs monitored. The L2 framework should be something the team actually relies on daily by then, not just my side project.

I should be comfortable with CI pipelines fully — setting them up, fixing them, not needing to ask DevOps for help every time something breaks.

Basically when something new comes in, people should think “let's check with Santhosh on how to test this” instead of “let's assign Santhosh to test this.” There's a difference.
```

### Q10. Now write the acceptance criteria. How will you KNOW you're ready? Not "I feel ready" — measurable criteria.


| #   | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Current Status (Met / Partially / Not Met) |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | I have at least **one automation framework** (for example, L2 screening) that is used by **more than just me**, with clear documentation and at least one release note showing improvements based on team feedback.    | Partially met                              |
| 2   | I have **end‑to‑end ownership of a Jenkins (or similar) pipeline**: I can create, modify, and fix it without hand‑holding, and it has been running reliably for at least 3 months.                                     | met                                        |
| 3   | I can point to **two concrete incidents** where my tools or frameworks reduced investigation/resolution time in a measurable way (e.g., “we saved ~30 minutes per incident over a month”).                             | Not met                                    |
| 4   | I run a **regular knowledge‑sharing practice** (even if it’s once a month) where I walk teammates through debugging approaches, tools, or new automation I’ve built, and at least one person has reused what I shared. | met                                        |


### Q11. What are your edge cases — the risks that could derail your career path?


| #   | Edge Case / Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Mitigation Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | I lean on AI heavily and sometimes I don’t fully understand what the generated code is doing. That’s fine now but it could catch up with me if I never build the deeper understanding. | I don’t have a perfect plan for this honestly. But I’m trying to manually rewrite or at least read through non-trivial AI code instead of just copy-pasting. |
| 2   | AI tools change fast. What I’m using now might be outdated in 6 months. | Try new tools on real small problems every couple of weeks, not just read about them. If it helps, use it. If not, drop it. |
| 3   | I sometimes build something experimental and it quietly becomes “the way we do things” without anyone deciding that. Then it’s hard to maintain. | Pilot with 1-2 people first. Keep a note on how to roll back if it doesn’t work. Don’t let experiments become permanent by accident. |
| 4   | I try to solve everything alone. When I’m stuck on infra or deployment stuff, I waste time instead of just asking someone who knows better. | Try to do at least one pairing session a month with someone from DevOps or whoever’s strong in my weak areas. Come with specific questions, not just “help me.” |


### Q12. Coulson asked Daisy: "Would you ship a product with that test plan?" Looking at your answers above — would YOU?

```
No. Not yet.

I know the direction — own systems, not just tasks. And I’ve started. But my acceptance criteria don’t lie: I can’t point to concrete incidents where my tools actually saved time in a measurable way. And the knowledge sharing is inconsistent.

If this were a product I’d say it’s in staging. Good enough to test, not ready to ship. I need a few more months of actually following through before I’d call this production-ready.
```

---

## PHASE 4: THE MENTOR MAP

*From S2E4 — "You don't have to be an expert to help someone. You just have to be one step ahead."*

Viktor was scared his advice wasn't good enough. It was fumbling, confusing, imperfect — and it was exactly what Daisy needed. Because he was one step ahead.

### Q13. Who are you ONE STEP AHEAD of right now? (Name a real person or describe the type of person — a junior colleague, a new hire, someone in another team.)

```
QA teammate who has recently started taking L2 issues but is still not very confident with debugging logs, reading stack traces, or deciding what to try next when things & setting the automated pipelines, designing the framework even with the different language.
```

### Q14. What specific thing could you teach or share with them THIS week? Not next quarter. This week.

```
This week, I can sit with them for **For How to use the claude for desiging a tool with the best practices that I know** and:

- Walk through my actual thought process step by step.
- Share the simple checklist I follow (what I look at first, second, and third).
- Show how I use AI as a second opinion instead of a decision‑maker.
```

### Q15. What has STOPPED you from mentoring or sharing so far? Be honest — is it time, fear of being wrong, not feeling expert enough, or something else?

```
Two main things:

1. **Feeling “not expert enough”** – I often tell myself, “I’m still figuring this out, who am I to teach someone else?” especially on topics like deployment or architecture.
2. **Assuming people are busy** – I don’t want to add to their calendar, so I wait for a “perfect time” that never really comes.
3. **Not getting the outcome which I expect** - No matter how hard I try to communicate,mentor or share knowledge with the team when i don't see a slight change, I feel de-motivated as well

I don’t need to teach everything; I just need to share the part I already do slightly better or more often than they do.
```

### Q16. Viktor said: "What if my advice is wrong? I'm still figuring this out myself." Have you ever held back from helping someone because you didn't feel qualified? What happened?

```
Yes. There have been times when a teammate struggled with a Jenkins issue or a tricky test failure, and I quietly tried to solve it on my own instead of offering to pair. I told myself, “Let me first figure it out fully, then I’ll share,” but by the time I was ready, the moment had passed.

The result was:
- They didn’t see my process or learn from it.
- I carried the stress alone instead of sharing responsibility.

Looking back, even a half‑baked suggestion or a “Let’s debug this together for 30 minutes” would have been more helpful than my silence.
```

## PHASE 5: THE PREVENTION AUDIT

*From S2E5 — "You're not building your replacement. You're building your ladder."*

Daisy had the fastest incident response on the team. Three SEV-1s in a month, all handled under 4 minutes. Same root cause. She was winning battles in a war she never tried to end.

### Q17. What are you doing repeatedly at work that you could prevent, automate, or delegate? List 3 recurring tasks that eat your time.


| #   | Recurring Task | How Often | Could Be: Prevented / Automated / Delegated? |
| --- | -------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1   |                |           |                                              |
| 2   |                |           |                                              |
| 3   |                |           |                                              |


### Q18. If you automated or delegated those 3 things, what would you do with the freed time? (Not "more of the same" — what HIGHER problem would you work on?)

```
[Your answer]
```

### Q19. Are you a firefighter or an architect right now? Firefighters fight the same fires forever. Architects automate the known to hunt the unknown.

```
[Your honest answer — and what would need to change to shift]
```

### Q20. What's your biggest fear about automating or delegating your current work? Is it that you'll be replaced, or is it something else?

```
[Your answer]
```

---

## PHASE 6: YOUR ARCHITECTURE

*From S2E6 — "You are the architect. In every universe. Build accordingly."*

This is the one you'll present to the team. All five phases led here.

### Q21. YOUR CAREER BLUEPRINT

Fill in your personal architecture. Be specific — no vague aspirations.
